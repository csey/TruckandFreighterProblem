Below a zip file which includes the documents needed for the truck-and-freighter project:

    A statement - note that this is a draft, the problem is mostly discussed in class.
    The tex source of the statement
    12 instances ranging from 8 to 12 customers
    One large instance file which should be the base for smaller instances if needed
    One time matrix from OSRM... note that the respect of triangular inequalities on this matrix is not guaranteed

Expected work to be returned: code + report


Deadline: November the 16th 2018
